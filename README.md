# LocalFileEncoder
Local File Encryption is a program for encrypting and expanding files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndael - a symmetric block encryption algorithm with a block size of 128 bits and a 256-bit key, which is generated based on the password.

A local file encryptor is a program for encrypting and expanding files that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndael, a symmetric block encryption algorithm with a block size of 128 bits and a 256-bit key that is generated based on a password. 
In order to encrypt the files it is necessary: 
•	Open them using the menu by going to File -> Open files and create the necessary files in the folder (on the panel you will enter their path). If the files are in different folders, you need to open them at the same time, and then open the others through the menu. You can also open files by browsing to them in the panel with the blue frame. 
•	To do this you need to enter a password, it must not be less than 4 characters, which can be pressed by clicking on the Show button.  
•	It is also possible to view the original files after encryption - these are the files that are encrypted. 
•	You also need to set the save path of the encrypted file, for this you need to go to the menu item Settings -> Change path for encrypted files and go to the save directory, also set the path for decrypted files to Settings -> Change path for decrypted files and go to the save directory. 
•	After that click on the Start button; 
In order to decrypt a file, you must:
•	Open the file with the extension .enc using the menu by going to File; Open the files and select the required file in the folder. You can also open a file to view it on the panel in the area with the blue frame; 
•	If you need to enter a password when encrypting a file, it must be at least 4 characters, which can be pressed on the Show button; 
•	It is also possible to view the encrypted file after the decryption is complete; 
•	If the path where the encrypted file will be saved is not set, go to the menu item Settings -> Change path for encrypted files and browse to the save directory, and also set the path for decrypted files to Settings -> Change path for decrypted files and go to the save directory;
•	Then click the Download button.
